# <Bootstrap-Portfolio>

## Description

In this project I was given an assignment where I had to deploy a portfolio website which includes a the previous work I have done in the past. 
I used HTML, CSS to style this website as well as Bootstrap Nav-bar and Jumobtron.

I enjoyed building this website because I was able to use the knowledge was given on previous classes. However I went the extra mile to make it more nicer for this I self learned bits and pieces.
